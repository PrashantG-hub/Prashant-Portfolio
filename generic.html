									<h1>Bank Loan SQL Report</h1>
									<p>Analyzed bank loan data using SQL to evaluate loan performance, identify good vs bad loans, and uncover trends in funding, repayment, and risk metrics for data-driven insights.</p>

								<p>The project began with cleaning and validating the raw bank loan data in SQL by handling missing values, correcting data types, and standardizing key fields. Next, exploratory analysis was performed to understand loan distribution, statuses, and trends over time. 
								<br>
									Key metrics such as total funded amount, good vs bad loan percentage, and repayment performance were then calculated using SQL queries. Finally, the results were structured into a clear, analysis-ready format suitable for reporting and business insights. </p>

									<h1>Spotify</h1>
									<p>This project analyzes Spotify’s music store data using SQL to understand customer behavior, music preferences, and revenue trends. The goal was to extract meaningful business insights by querying multiple related tables such as customers, invoices, tracks, artists, and genres.</p>

								<div class="image main"><img src="https://th.bing.com/th/id/R.179af03fc01e5cccab135cccbb671796?rik=huIssZ5y2pCPxA&riu=http%3a%2f%2ftous-logos.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2018%2f05%2fLogo-Spotify.png&ehk=w0gRWUDJKgAxWxbfNqJa%2b5KzHsPB4JUjIFwh38aZYUk%3d&risl=&pid=ImgRaw&r=0" alt="" /></div>
								
Started with simple queries to understand the dataset, such as identifying the senior-most employee, countries with the most invoices, top invoice values, and the best-performing cities and customers based on total spending.

<br>
Analyzed customer listening behavior by identifying rock music listeners, ordering them by email, and determining which artists produced the most rock tracks. This involved multiple joins across customer, invoice, track, album, and genre tables.
Compared individual track durations against the average song length to identify longer tracks, helping understand content distribution in the catalog.
Used Common Table Expressions (CTEs) to calculate how much each customer spent on specific artists and to identify top-selling artists.
Applied window functions (ROW_NUMBER) to determine the most popular music genre per country and identify top-spending customers per country, including handling ties correctly.
<br>
The project delivered clear insights into customer spending patterns, popular genres by country, top artists, and high-value customers, showcasing strong SQL skills in joins, subqueries, CTEs, and window functions.

									<h1>WalMart</h1>
									<p>This project focuses on analyzing Walmart sales data using SQL to understand customer behavior, product performance, and sales trends. The objective was to perform end-to-end analysis—from data loading and feature engineering to exploratory data analysis and business insights.</p>
			<li><a href="https://github.com/PrashantG-hub/SQL-EDA-and-cleaning/blob/main/Walmart%20SQL%20Queries.sql" class="button">View Project</a></li>

								<div class="image main"><img src="https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/tit2CEbn4-ZZbLZTwZAzO1styl5uMK_7Zz4XiuDFBgIjpSbC3d1SVnyN3xf829gJXR36llSAsEW8bWkBHp5I-7HJnARJpNA_6CvFvPmn4ayPPHLgnrKW8WW7431a6iLCfpJ6Uty9YryCECRqpCv468o" alt="" /></div>
								
Derived new analytical columns such as:
<br>
Time of Day (Morning, Afternoon, Evening)
<br>
Day Name
<br>
Month Name
<br>
These features enabled better time-based and behavioral analysis.
Performed high-level analysis to understand store presence, branches, cities, product lines, payment methods, and overall dataset structure.
Identified top-selling product lines, highest revenue-generating products, cities, and months, along with VAT and COGS analysis to understand profitability.
Analyzed sales patterns by time of day and weekday, identified high-revenue customer types, and evaluated branch-level performance.
Explored customer demographics, payment preferences, gender distribution, ratings behavior, and purchasing patterns across branches and time periods.
<br>
The project provided actionable insights into sales trends, customer behavior, product performance, and profitability, demonstrating practical SQL skills in data loading, feature engineering, aggregation, conditional logic, and business-focused analysis.
